I'm a senior student at Shanghai Jiaotong University, major in Information Security. Since the summer vacation of my sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Kenny Q. Zhu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/). Later, I took a research internship at [SYNYI.AI](https://www.synyi.com/), which is a medical AI start-up. I'm recently working on a UM-SJTU project, focusing on causality extraction. Generally speaking, my research interest includes Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge Representation, etc.

I'm admitted to Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Fall 2018.
