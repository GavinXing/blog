I'm a senior student at Shanghai Jiaotong University, major in Information Security. Since the summer vacation of my sophomore year, I have been advised by [Prof. Kenny Q. Zhu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/). I'm now taking a research internship at [SYNYI.AI](https://www.synyi.com/), which is a medical AI start-up. My research interest includes Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, etc.
