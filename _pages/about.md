I'm a master student at University of Michigan, major in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm now working with [Prof. H.V. Jagadish](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/) at [UM DBGroup](http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu). Generally speaking, my research interest includes Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge Representation, etc.

Before my graduate study, I got my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiaotong University. I worked with [Prof. Kenny Q. Zhu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/) since the summer vacation of my sophomore year.
